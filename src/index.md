# This is Control Delete
We are a human rights organization focused on the eradication of bullying in the tech sector.

We support advocacy and direct action that provides workers with safe, creative workplaces. We advocate directly for a cultural shift in STEM education toward more welcoming, bully free learning environments. And we support legislative changes that close the loopholes for abuse in the workplace.

In rare instances, we use donated voting stock to affect change through investor advocacy.
